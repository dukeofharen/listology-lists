# Best classic trance (by ?)

Classic trance is not a real subgenre of trance, it's a name given to early trance music that wasn't strictly defined. And right because of that undefineness, it was the only real type of trance, since only music that is free of all limitations and formulas can entrance and hypnotize you - that is, achieve the true goal of trance music.
The whole story started in 1990 (although there was a couple of trancey tracks in the 80s, but more about them later) with Age Of Love in Belgium and Dance 2 Trance in Germany and their singles The Age Of Love and We Came In Peace. But trance really kicked off a year later with the creation of two German labels that helped to define a unique sound, that will at first be called techno-trance or trance-dance and later just trance. That two labels were MFS (founded by Mark Reeder and based in Berlin) and Eye Q (founded by Sven Väth and based in Frankfurt). Both of them had the same goal: to produce and release hypnotic techno music that will take a listener on a journey.
Trance got its distinctive sound and identity just a year later when Harald Blüchel joined MFS family and started to release his specifically melodic trance tracks. At the same time Sven Väth opened Harthouse, sublabel of Eye Q, which immediately generated success, because it offered some other types of trance besides the standard type (which was reserved for Eye Q), such as acid trance (Hardfloor), hard trance (Arpeggiators), tribal trance (The Ambush) and even some weird spacey type of trance that only one man know to do (Spicelab). Pretty soon trance become the most exciting sound in Germany (and wider Europe, especially after Jam & Spoon's remix of The Age Of Love) and everyone tried to make it (or at least incorporate elements of it in their own sound).
But the real explosion happened in 1993 when Superstition opened its doors and Oliver Lieb started to release pure trance under his L.S.G. moniker on it. Paul Van Dyk also established himself on the scene with his remix of Humate's Love Stimulation, Pete Namlook released couple of his very influental trance albums and trance finally took off in England, mainly thanks to Caspar Pound and Simon Berry.
In 1994 original sound of trance slowly started to diminish as epic type of progressive house (which will later transform to progressive trance) and progressive trance started to emerge. Some producers continued to release classic trance while other switched to sound that Perfecto and Hooj were promoting back then. Final kick to raw sound of classic trance came in 1995, when Robert Miles conquered the world (of EDM) with Children.
Short list of people mostly responsible for creation and definition of trance sound:
- Mark Reeder - established the first real trance label (MFS), discovered Cosmic Baby, PVD, Effective Force and other well-known trance acts.
- Sven Väth - the main pusher of trance sound in clubs, founded Eye Q and Harthouse and was involved in first trance hit (Zyon - No Fate).
- Rolf Ellmer/Dag Lerner - duo responsible for creation of german trance style, involved in highly influental Dance 2 Trance and Peyote projects. DJ Dag was, next to Sven Väth, the most important classic trance dj.
- Harald Blüchel - introduced the more melodic sound of trance, created the first mixed trance compilation (Tranceformed From Beyond) and released Stellar Supreme, landmark album in trance history.
- Oliver Lieb - prolific artist that ruled the scene with his Spicelab and L.S.G. projects.
- Pete Namlook - although he's better known as ambient producer, he released some very influental trance albums as Sequential, 4Voice and Hearts Of Space (mostly in collaboration with other trance producers).
- Jürgen Driessen - king of acid trance, released more than 200 records on many famous labels. Oliver Lieb of acid trance.
- Ralf Hildenbeutel/Matthias Hoffmann/Steffen Britzke - trio that produced so many classics under various monikers, studio producers of Sven Väth and people responsible for establishing Eye Q as the premier classic trance label.
- Caspar Pound - founded Rising High (when he was only 19) and UK division of Harthouse. Rising High (along with Simon Berry's Platipus label) is one of the labels mostly responsible for breakthrough of trance in UK, thanks to licencing rare records from Fax +49-69/450464 label and The Secret Life Of Trance, seminal compilation series.

Trance and trancey tracks existed even before 1990, and here are some 80s trancey tracks:
- Night Moves - Transdance (New York Disco Mix) [1983] - totally futuristic and hypnotic disco track that sounded nothing like other disco music of that time.
- The KLF - What Time Is Love? [1988] - especially the a-side of this vinyl, that employs the beats under the trippy acid loop at various stages of the track. It's - the first record in so-called Pure Trance series, and many believe that the whole trance story started right here with this track.
- Space Opera - Space Opera Theme [1989] - Belgian new beat track from the end of the 80s, but more melodic and trancey than avarage new beat track of the 80s.
