# Best progressive house (by ?)

Progressive house is (more) sophisticated version of house music, that first appeared at the beginning of the 90-ies. First prog. house records started to come out on labels such as Guerilla, Cowboy and Stress. The most important artists at the time were Leftfield and Spooky (production-wise) and Sasha & Digweed (DJ-wise). The latter two started to play at Mansfield based club Renaissance which opened in 1991. They were pushing prog. house sound in it from the beginnings. Everything culminated in 1994, when they released Renaissance - The Mix Collection, the most important prog. house compilation ever. 3-disc set featured some of their favourite tracks, which were being played a lot during their residency at the Renaissance club. But that compilation also indicated the peak of the movement, and also the end of the first prog. house wave.
After that, the scene was taken by some new names such as BT, Blue Amazon and Way Out West. Their sound was a little different, more epic and trancy. It started to sound very similar to prog. trance, which also appeared at that time. Sometimes, the only difference between them was a BPM (lower-house, higher-trance).
Old labels started to close down, and some new, important opened up (Jackpot, Yoshitoshi and later Bedrock). Around 1997, Boxed started Global Underground series, which gave a new boost to prog. house and lanched Nick Warren, Dave Seaman and Deep Dish on the forefront of prog. house movement.
Around 2003, some "new" artists (Holden, Petter, Nathan Fake, The MFA) appeared, who started to develop minimal, techy, idm-influenced prog. house sound. On the other hand, people like Luke Chable and Eelke Kleijn are doing exactly opposite: full and very melodic prog. house. Both sides sound fantastic, so it's not hard to see the bright future for prog. house.
